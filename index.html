  <p>I’m 24 years old, I live in Goulburn, A rural town in New South Wales (NSW).Which is in between Canberra and Sydney, It’s about forty minutes to Canberra and two hours to the Batemans Bay and about two and a half hours to Sydney,I believe Goulburn is geographically located well in New South Wales. Here’s an interesting fact about Goulburn which is it was proclaimed the first inland city by letters patent by Queen Victoria in 1863. A fact about myself is that i'm a film enthusiast, I like seeing how the reactions to new films screening out of TIFF, the toronto film festival and i also enjoy eatching foreign films like 2022 Indian film  Rise Roar Revolt also known as RRR by S.S. Rajamouli, 2019 South Korean film Parasite by Bong Joon Ho and 2021 Japanese film Drive my car by Ryûsuke Hamaguchi.</p>

<h1 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue"font-size:50px;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT is goes back a few years ago to the senior classes of year 11 and 12 in high school, one of the electives i had chosen was IPT (information processes technology) because a few of my friends had chosen it, I learned a lot about computers during that course and how to fix problems with technology, one of my favorite sayings i learned was, if your piece of technology isn’t working is to turn it off and on again. I found this saying to be very helpful in fixing technology. For example, whenever my LG smart tv gets disconnected to the internet, which seems to be happening a lot more frequently now, is to turn the power off at the wall and what for about 10-15 seconds. IT has always been an interest in my life after finshing my highschool IT course. I decided to choose rmit university because it is ranked highly in the global rankings it is easily inside the top five hundred universitys ranked at three houndred and twenty two,I also decided to pick rmit university because i am able to work and have flecxible study hours which is a great help.</p>

<p> I am a Number 9 personality </p>
<h2><b>How i feel about the results of these tests.</b></h2>
<p>I am a ISFJ personality, which stands for Introverted, Sensing, Judging and feeling personality.
ISFJ personalities are usually practical, hardworking, supportive and true to their word, dependable and loyal, furthermore ISFJs are patient and understanding. But the problems for ISFJ personalities is that they are resistant to change and are immersed in pessimism seeing the worst in people, one problem I have being a ISFJ is that I take things to personally and it hits me to my core. Shyness and coming out of my shell and opening to people is another one of my problems, my big five personality results say that I’m in the peacemaker circle and that I’m shy, anxious and self-conscious, but it also says that I have high trust, agreeableness and high conscientiousness. The Enneagram test says that I’m a number 9 personality which is the peacemaker, which is being calm, mellow and generally liked by most other people, problems that pacemakers have is that they may become self-critical and sluggish and procrastinating their time away. What I have learned through these tests is that I must stop being self-critical, be more open and use my time and my groups time efficiently and effectively, these tests have shown me that it’s time to get out of my comfort zone and try new things and broaden my horizons.</p>

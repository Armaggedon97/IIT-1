<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>About Me.</h2>
<p>My name is Harrison Groarke, I’m 24 years old, I live in Goulburn, A rural town in New South Wales (NSW).Which is in between Canberra and Sydney, It’s about forty minutes to Canberra and two hours to the Batemans Bay and about two and a half hours to Sydney,I believe Goulburn is geographically located well in New South Wales. Here’s an interesting fact about Goulburn which is it was proclaimed the first inland city by letters patent by Queen Victoria in 1863.
<p>A fact about myself is that i'm a film enthusiast, I like seeing how the reactions to new films screening out of TIFF, the toronto film festival and i also enjoy eatching foreign films like 2022 Indian film  Rise Roar Revolt also known as RRR by S.S. Rajamouli, 2019 South Korean film Parasite by Bong Joon Ho and 2021 Japanese film Drive my car by Ryûsuke Hamaguchi.</p>

<h1 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue";>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT is goes back a few years ago to the senior classes of year 11 and 12 in high school, one of the electives in had chosen was IPT (information processes technology) because a few of my friends had chosen it, a learned a lot about computers during that course and how to fix problems, one of my favorite sayings was if your piece of technology  isn’t working is to turn it off and on again, the secret to fixing technology whenever my old smart tv gets disconnected to the internet which seems to be happening a lot more frequently now is to turn the power off at the wall and what for about 10-15 seconds before turning it on usually fixes it. It has always been an interest in my life, I don’t wake up sad knowing that I have too study IT and learn math’s today, I quite enjoy knowing that at the end of the day I will be smarter than when I started it. I felt a bit directionless after finishing high school, so I just worked for a while, after a while I got burnt out of work I wasn’t enjoying a decided that I want to do something I enjoy and pay’s alright, knowing how bad the housing prices are at the moment, so I broke out of comfort zone and applied to this IT course.</p>

  <p>I’m 24 years old, I live in Goulburn, A rural town in New South Wales (NSW).Which is in between Canberra and Sydney, It’s about forty minutes to Canberra and two hours to the Batemans Bay and about two and a half hours to Sydney,I believe Goulburn is geographically located well in New South Wales. Here’s an interesting fact about Goulburn which is it was proclaimed the first inland city by letters patent by Queen Victoria in 1863. A fact about myself is that i'm a film enthusiast, I like seeing how the reactions to new films screening out of TIFF, the toronto film festival and i also enjoy eatching foreign films like 2022 Indian film  Rise Roar Revolt also known as RRR by S.S. Rajamouli, 2019 South Korean film Parasite by Bong Joon Ho and 2021 Japanese film Drive my car by Ryûsuke Hamaguchi.</p>

<h1 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue"font-size:50px;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT is goes back a few years ago to the senior classes of year 11 and 12 in high school, one of the electives in had chosen was IPT (information processes technology) because a few of my friends had chosen it, a learned a lot about computers during that course and how to fix problems, one of my favorite sayings was if your piece of technology  isn’t working is to turn it off and on again, the secret to fixing technology whenever my old smart tv gets disconnected to the internet which seems to be happening a lot more frequently now is to turn the power off at the wall and what for about 10-15 seconds before turning it on usually fixes it. It has always been an interest in my life, I don’t wake up sad knowing that I have too study IT and learn math’s today, I quite enjoy knowing that at the end of the day I will be smarter than when I started it. I felt a bit directionless after finishing high school, so I just worked for a while, after a while I got burnt out of work I wasn’t enjoying a decided that I want to do something I enjoy and pay’s alright, knowing how bad the housing prices are at the moment, so I broke out of comfort zone and applied to this IT course.</p>

<h1 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue"font-size:50px;">Ideal Job</h1>
<p>I would like to work in cybersecurity because it would be nice to protect people and organizations  from unwarranted cyber attacks after they have worked hard on a project just to have everything slip out from under them in a moment’s notice.
I would like to work in computer security specifically as an IT security specialist. IT security specialists oversee helping to look after an organization’s computers from cyberattacks, making sure their data stays safe and secure.

To become an IT security specialist, you will need a degree in an IT related course like information security, network technology, computer science, computers or Information technology (the course I am studying)
It is suggested that while you are studying that you should go and try an internship or an entry level position such as IT technical support to gain hands on experience will help make you marketable to employers, also learning a recommended certification such as
 - CompTIA-Security+ (4-day course)
- Certified information security manager (4-day course)
-  Certified ethical hacker (5-day course)
Learning languages like python can set you apart from other candidates, programming helps create scripts for when you are trying to penetrate the security at higher levels of the job. And finally, a master’s in information security systems or cyber security which is both two years. So, all up 3 years for the IT degree, a month doing certifications courses and two years getting a master’s degree, so all up five years.</p>

<p><a href=https://www.truity.com/test-results/enneagram/18223/36037305>My Results</a></p>
<p> I am a Number 9 personality </p>
<h2><b>How i feel about the results of these tests.</b></h2>
<p>I am a ISFJ personality, which stands for Introverted, Sensing, Judging and feeling personality.
ISFJ personalities are usually practical, hardworking, supportive and true to their word, dependable and loyal, furthermore ISFJs are patient and understanding. But the problems for ISFJ personalities is that they are resistant to change and are immersed in pessimism seeing the worst in people, one problem I have being a ISFJ is that I take things to personally and it hits me to my core. Shyness and coming out of my shell and opening to people is another one of my problems, my big five personality results say that I’m in the neurotic circle and that I’m shy, anxious and self-conscious, but it also says that I have high trust, agreeableness and high conscientiousness. The Enneagram test says that I’m a number 9 personality which is the peacemaker, which is being calm, mellow and generally liked by most other people, problems that pacemakers have is that they may become self-critical and sluggish and procrastinating their time away. What I have learned through these tests is that I must stop being self-critical, be more open and use my time and my groups time efficiently and effectively, these tests have shown me that it’s time to get out of my comfort zone and try new things and broaden my horizons.</p>

<h1 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue"font-size:50px;"> My Project Idea</h1>
<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<p>My idea is to turn a raspberry pi into a cheaper affordable way to turn a normal tv into a smart tv, when you plug the raspberry pi into the back of a TV like a Chromecast, Usb or some other peripheral using  HDMI or Usb slots, when the pi is inserted into the TV it runs webOS (operating system) using the open-source LG webOS application using the raspberry pi. It also connects to your TV remote to the raspberry pi "Smart device", by using the Simplink button on your tv remote. Fully capable Smart TV just by using a modded Raspberry pi 4 plugged into the back of a non smart TV.</P>

<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
<p>My product features the use of a Raspberry pi 4, running the latest version of the WebOS software while also having applications such as Netflix, YouTube and other media applications while also having internet connectivity, to make sure the streaming apps work properly as they need to be connected to the internet and be able to keep up to date with updates for the streaming apps. I want my device to be something like a Chromecast that you plug into the back of a tv using the HDMI or Usb port. I would also like to add a case to the raspberry pi 4,so that it doesn’t look like microchips hanging from the back of the TV unit. I hope when the “Smart Device” is turned on is that, when you change the TV to one of the HDMI ports, it boots up WebOS, loads the apps like Netflix, YouTube etc. I also hope to have a application store in case the applications you want aren’t on the “Smart device” can be downloaded and ready to use. When you boot up the “Smart device” for the first time, you get asked to connect your TV remote to the "Smart device" by pressing the "simplink" button on the tv remote, then it will connect to the Smart device allowing you to use the device with your own TV remote. I would like to have web browser supoort from one of the application widgets,allowing you use the internet and look up information.</P>

<h2><b>Tools and Techniques</b></h2>
<p>The main piece of technology used is the Raspberry pi 4.</P><a href="https://raspberry.piaustralia.com.au/products/raspberry-pi-4">Raspberry PI 4 </a></p><p>The features of this product include using the raspberry pi 4 and a officially supported item the WebOS open-source edition linked here:<p><a href="https://www.webosose.org/">WebOS open-source link!</a></p> It will also wi-fi connectivity available in the raspberry pi 4. For this project idea you will need the latest version open source webOS software itself. For example installing the Netflix application on the raspberry pi you need the Netflix windows authentication key repository, which uses the chromium browser that comes preinstalled in the raspberry pi 4, we will also use the coding language python so we can code the raspberry pi 4 to get everything we want on it. The coding language python comes from another repository called the CastagnalIT repository.We also have to make the TV remote that is used by the TV itself usable by the “Smart device”. Turnig your tv remote into a “smart remote” using the HDMI- CEC feature on your tv to turn your remote into a "smart remote" compatible to the raspberry pi  4 by using the “simplink” button on your tv remote.</p>


<h2><b>Outcome</b></h2>
if this project is successful because it would be good for a lot of  people to be able to have access to Netflix, YouTube, Amazon prime and other services, without having to cast things from their phone.  Being able to turn on the TV and seeing an easy-to-understand interface in this case the WebOS and easily being able to pick the apps of choice without having to spend a lot of money on a new tv. If the original problem is solved of being able to put make a normal tv into a smart tv, I would be very happy, and I would be able to use it at home right now.

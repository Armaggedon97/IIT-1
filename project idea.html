<h1 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue"font-size:50px;"> My Project Idea</h1>
<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<p>My idea is to turn a raspberry pi into a cheaper affordable way to turn a normal tv into a smart tv, when you plug the raspberry pi into the back of a TV like a Chromecast, Usb or some other peripheral using  HDMI or Usb slots, when the pi is inserted into the Tv it runs web os (operating system) using the open-source LG webOS application using the raspberry pi, also connecting your remote to raspberry pi "Smart device" by using the Simplink button on your tv remote. Fully capable Smart TV just by using Raspberry pi.</P>

<h1 style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue"font-size:50px;"> My Project Idea</h1>
<h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
<p>My idea is to turn a raspberry pi into a cheaper affordable way to turn a normal tv into a smart tv, when you plug the raspberry pi into the back of a TV like a Chromecast, Usb or some other peripheral using  HDMI or Usb slots, when the pi is inserted into the Tv it runs web os (operating system) using the open-source LG webOS application using the raspberry pi, also connecting your remote to raspberry pi "Smart device" by using the Simplink button on your tv remote. Fully capable Smart TV just by using Raspberry pi.</P>

<h2><b>Description</b></h2>
<p>My product features the Raspberry pi 4, running the latest version of the WebOS software while also having apps such as Netflix, YouTube and internet connectivity to get the streaming apps working and be able to keep up to date with updates for the streaming apps, I want my device to be something like a Chromecast that you plug into the back of a tv using the HDMI port, also adding a case to the raspberry pi so it doesn’t look like microchips hanging from the back of the TV unit. I hope when the “Smart Device” is turned on is that, when you change the TV to the HDMI slot, it boots up WebOS, loads the apps like Netflix, YouTube etc. but there is also an application store in case the applications you want aren’t on the “Smart device”. When you boot up the “Smart device” for the first time you get asked to connect your tv remote by pressing the simplink button on the tv remote, thus connecting to the Smart device and allowing you to use the device with your own tv remote. I would like web browser accessibility from one of the application widgets allowing you use the internet and look up information.</P>

<h2><b>Tools and Techniques</b></h2>
<p>The features of this product include using a raspberry pi 4, an officially supported item of the WebOS open-source edition linked here:<p><a href="https://www.webosose.org/">WebOS open-source link!</a></p> and wi-fi connectivity available from the latest version of the pi. The latest version open source webOS software itself, installing Netflix for example on the raspberry pi you need the Netflix windows authentication key repository which uses the chromium browser which comes with the raspberry pi software preinstalled, we also use the coding language python so we can add the code we need to get it working. The coding language python comes from another repository called the CastagnalIT repository. We also have to make a tv remote that is able to be used by the “Smart device”. So, something like a “smart remote” using the HDMI- CEC feature on your tv to turn your remote into a remote able to be used by raspberry pi by using the “simplink” button on your tv remote.</p>


<h2><b>Outcome</b></h2>
if this project is successful because it would be good for a lot of  people to be able to have access to Netflix, YouTube, Amazon prime and other services, without having to cast things from their phone.  Being able to turn on the TV and seeing an easy-to-understand interface in this case the WebOS and easily being able to pick the apps of choice without having to spend a lot of money on a new tv. If the original problem is solved of being able to put make a normal tv into a smart tv, I would be very happy, and I would be able to use it at home right now.
